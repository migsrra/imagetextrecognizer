# Created by group 34 for APS360 at the University of Toronto!
What you'll find in this repository:
- Complete source code for our data gathering and cleaning, baseline model (EasyOCR) testing, our model, training code and results, and more!
- A report the team made upon completion of the project 

Status:
- Requires training over a much larger dataset, but we're seeing good promise
